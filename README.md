# Wordpress lets encrypt with Traefik v2
This installation works with an existing traefik 2 network. Please change compose file to match your setup.

## Configuration
1. Firstly you'll need to setup the `.env` file by copying the `.env.example` file and editing the variables.
2. You then need to confirm your traefik configuration is the same. You can checkout my traefik and gitlab setup for more info.
